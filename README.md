# Security Attack Classification

A machine learning project to **classify different types of security attacks** (or intrusion / threat classifications) using your dataset. The goal is to build a robust model that can detect and categorize potential security attacks from network / system logs or packet data.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Multi-class classification of different security attacks  
- Feature engineering on network / system logs  
- Trainable ML / DL models (e.g. Random Forest, Neural Networks)  
- Evaluation metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC, Precision / Recall, F1-score  
- Option to save and load trained models  
- (Optional) Real-time attack detection (if applicable)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Describe your dataset source (e.g. publicly available IDS dataset, custom logs)  
- Format of dataset: CSV, JSON, PCAP, etc  
- Features in the dataset: e.g. “src_ip, dst_ip, protocol, packet_length, …”  
- How many samples / rows  

---

## 📚 Reference / Resources

- Mention any IDS / security datasets you used (e.g. KDD99, NSL-KDD, CICIDS)  
- Research papers or blogs that inspired the approach  
- Tutorials / libraries you followed
