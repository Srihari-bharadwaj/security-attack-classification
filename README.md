## Security Attack Classification

A machine learning project to classify different types of security attacks (intrusion / threat classifications). The goal is to build a model that can detect and categorize potential security attacks from network or system logs.

## Features

- Multi-class classification of security attacks  
- Feature engineering on network or system logs  
- Trainable ML models such as Random Forest or Neural Networks  
- Evaluation metrics: confusion matrix, ROC, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Save and load trained models  

---

## Dataset

- Dataset used: NSL-KDD  
- Format: CSV  
- Features include attributes such as protocol, duration, service, packet length, etc.  
- Includes multiple categories of attack types for classification tasks
